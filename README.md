<h1>Rehearsify: Streamline Your Music Education</h1>
<p>As a music educator, managing rehearsals and lessons can be a daunting task. That's why I created Rehearsify, a web application designed to help you keep your rehearsals organized and on track. Built using Python, Flask, Jinja, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SQLAlchemy, and SQLite (with the option to upgrade to Postgres), Rehearsify is the ultimate tool for music educators.</p>
<h2>Features:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>An FAQ page to help users with common questions</li>
  <li>User account creation with password hashing and salting for added security</li>
  <li>Authentication to ensure users only access their own data</li>
  <li>Create, edit, and delete rehearsals for any group</li>
  <li>Rehearsals are neatly organized by group for easy access</li>
  <li>Download rehearsals as a PDF for record-keeping or sharing with admin or colleagues</li>
  <li>Track rehearsals as 'upcoming' or 'past'</li>

</ul>
<h2>Rehearsify started as a passion projectâœ¨</h2>
<p>As a music educator, I understand the importance of staying organized and on top of rehearsals and lessons. That's why I created Rehearsify, a tool that I wish I had when I was starting out.</p>
